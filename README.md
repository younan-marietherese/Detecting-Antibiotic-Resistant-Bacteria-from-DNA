# Detecting Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria from DNA

This project aims to detect antibiotic-resistant bacteria by analyzing DNA sequences. The goal is to identify specific genetic markers or mutations in bacterial DNA that confer resistance to antibiotics, using machine learning or bioinformatics approaches.

## Project Overview
Antibiotic resistance is a growing threat in healthcare, and identifying resistant bacteria quickly and accurately is crucial for effective treatment. This project uses DNA sequence data to detect the presence of antibiotic-resistant genes in bacteria. By analyzing specific sequences and features from the DNA, we can build a model that predicts whether a strain of bacteria is resistant to antibiotics.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of DNA sequences from bacterial strains, some of which are resistant to antibiotics. The DNA sequences are processed to extract relevant features, such as nucleotide patterns or specific gene markers associated with resistance. These features are used as inputs for machine learning models.

The dataset may contain the following features:
- **DNA Sequences**: Raw sequences of bacterial DNA.
- **Resistance Labels**: Binary labels indicating whether the bacteria are resistant to antibiotics.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the DNA sequence data and preprocess it for analysis.
   - Extract features from the sequences, such as nucleotide frequencies, gene markers, or mutations known to confer antibiotic resistance.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to classify bacteria as resistant or non-resistant.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as:
     - **Accuracy**
     - **Precision**
     - **Recall**
     - **F1-score**
   - Use cross-validation and confusion matrices to assess the quality of the predictions.

4. **Feature Importance**:
   - Identify the most important features or DNA sequences that contribute to the model’s predictions.
   - Explore potential biomarkers that could be indicative of antibiotic resistance.
